## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

This template is made by using several technologies.
Below are explanations about where to find specific code.

### HTML

HTML files are stored in a folder called `templates`. Files have `.html` extension.
In `templates/base.html` you can add your external links and scripts, or change other meaningful things that is relevant on every page.
You can find other templates in `templates/`.

### CSS

CSS files can be found in `/blog/static/css`.  

### Core files

You can find:
  - views in `blank/views.py`.
  - local URL configuration in `blank/urls.py`.
  - global URL configuration in `blank_template/urls.py`.
  - models (for tables) in `blank/models.py`.
  - static files in `blank/static`.
  - settings in blank_template/settings.py

## Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `sqlite:///w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   
For this template, the database connection path can also be found in the environment.  

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note
For now files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
